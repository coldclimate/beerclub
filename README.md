## Contributing

BeerClub was started not only as a fun way to find other people in the company I was working for but as a sneaky way to get people to learn some Git.

### Sending in changes

If you'd like to contribute, we follow the [Fork and PR](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) model for contribution.

### Running the tests

Yes, even your beer comments should result in valid JSON and to check that we have a unit test (a bad one, please feel free to write a better one).

To run the test...

`` python test.py ``
